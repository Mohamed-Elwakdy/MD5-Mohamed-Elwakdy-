## Introduction 

<br>

##### This dataset pull from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. 

#### I used Python 3 to work on this Assesment. I built two predictive models using XGBoost and Random Forest. XGBoost and Random forest are the best two machine learning algorithms that I used for building predictive models. XGboost can handle the missing values and Random Forest can be used to get a low variance in addion to this algorithm is used to find out the most important independent variables and can be used  with subsampling techniques to deal with a big data.   

#### The best perfomance of both models I get using those two predictive models when I increased the number of trees 'n_estimatores' and 'max_depth' hyperparameters where I got the highest train_scores and test_scores and lowest mse_train and mse_test.
